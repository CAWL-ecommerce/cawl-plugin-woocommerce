 * Transient token bucket for the return-page AJAX endpoint, keyed on the order id.

 * The bucket is deliberately *not* keyed on the WooCommerce session or the client IP.
 * A rate limit must bind to something the abuser cannot rotate:
 * `WC()->session->get_customer_id()` is derived from a request cookie the attacker
 * simply omits, which hands them a fresh bucket on every request (and would in
 * practice only count legitimate shoppers); the client IP rotates just as easily.
 * The order id is attacker-independent and is the natural unit of abuse for this
 * endpoint, since every request must name the order it wants to act on.
 *
 * The bucket is advisory — a cost cap, not a security boundary. Authorization is
 * the boundary and is enforced separately.
